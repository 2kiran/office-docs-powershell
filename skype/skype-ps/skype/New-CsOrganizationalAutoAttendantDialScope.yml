  This cmdlet creates a new dial-scope to be used with Auto Attendant (AA) service. OAAs use dial-scopes to restrict the scope of call transfers that can be made through directory lookup feature. 

  **NOTE**
  - The returned dial-scope model composes a member for the underlying type/implementation, e.g. in case of the group-based dial scope, in order to modify its Group IDs, you can access them through `DialScope.GroupScope.GroupIds`.
