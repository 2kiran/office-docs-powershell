### YamlMime:PowershellCmdlet
summary: |-
  This cmdlet is available only in the Exchange Online PowerShell V2 module. For more information, see [About the Exchange Online PowerShell V2 module](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/exchange/exchange-online-powershell-v2).

  Use the Connect-IPPSSession cmdlet in the Exchange Online PowerShell V2 module to connect to Security & Compliance Center PowerShell or standalone Exchange Online Protection PowerShell using modern authentication. The cmdlet works for MFA or non-MFA enabled accounts.

  **Note**: If your organization is on-premises Exchange, and you have Exchange Enterprise CAL with Services licenses for Exchange Online Protection (EOP), use the [Connect-ExchangeOnline](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/exchange/connect-exchangeonline) cmdlet in the [Exchange Online PowerShell connection instructions](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/exchange/connect-to-exchange-online-powershell) to connect to your EOP PowerShell environment.

  For information about the parameter sets in the Syntax section below, see [Exchange cmdlet syntax](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/exchange/exchange-cmdlet-syntax).

examples:
- title: Example 1
  code: |-
    $UserCredential = Get-Credential
    Connect-IPPSSession -Credential $UserCredential
  description: |-
    This example connects to Security & Compliance Center PowerShell in a Microsoft 365 organization.

    The first command gets the user credentials and stores them in the $UserCredential variable.

    The second command connects the current PowerShell session using the credentials in the $UserCredential, which isn't MFA enabled.

    After the Connect-IPPSSession command is complete, the password key in the $UserCredential variable is emptied, and you can run Security & Compliance Center PowerShell cmdlets.

  code: |-
    Connect-IPPSSession -Credential (Get-Credential) -ConnectionUri https://ps.protection.outlook.com/powershell-liveid/
  description: |-
    This example connects to standalone Exchange Online Protection PowerShell in an organization that doesn't have Exchange Online mailboxes.

parameters:
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: AzureADAuthorizationEndpointUri
  description: |+
    The AzureADAuthorizationEndpointUri parameter specifies the Azure AD Authorization endpoint that can issue OAuth2 access tokens. The following PowerShell environments and related values are supported:

    - Security & Compliance Center PowerShell in Microsoft 365 or Microsoft 365 GCC: Don't use this parameter. The required value is `https://login.microsoftonline.com/common`, but that's also the default value, so you don't need to use this parameter.
    - Security & Compliance Center PowerShell in Office 365 Germany: `https://login.microsoftonline.de/common`
    - Security & Compliance Center PowerShell in Microsoft GCC High or Microsoft DoD: `https://login.microsoftonline.us/common`

    If you use the UserPrincipalName parameter, you don't need to use the AzureADAuthorizationEndpointUri parameter for MFA or federated users in environments that normally require it (UserPrincipalName or AzureADAuthorizationEndpointUri is required; OK to use both).

  defaultValue: None
  position: "1"
  aliases: ""
  applicable:
  - Exchange Online
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: BypassMailboxAnchoring
  description: |+
    The BypassMailboxAnchoring switch bypasses the use of the mailbox anchoring hint. You don't need to specify a value with this switch.

  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" /><span>[</span><span>]</span>
  name: CommandName
  description: |+
    The CommandName parameter specifies the comma separated list of commands to import into the session. Use this parameter for applications or scripts that use a specific set of cmdlets. Reducing the number of cmdlets in the session helps improve performance and reduces the memory footprint of the application or script.

  defaultValue: None
  position: "5"
  aliases: ""

  - Exchange Online
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: ConnectionUri
  description: |+
    The ConnectionUri parameter specifies the connection endpoint for the remote PowerShell session. The following PowerShell environments and related values are supported:

    - Security & Compliance Center PowerShell in Microsoft 365 or Microsoft 365 GCC: Don't use this parameter. The required value is `https://ps.compliance.protection.outlook.com/powershell-liveid/`, but that's also the default value, so you don't need to use this parameter.
    - Security & Compliance Center PowerShell in Office 365 Germany: `https://ps.compliance.protection.outlook.de/PowerShell-LiveID`
    - Security & Compliance Center PowerShell in Microsoft GCC High: `https://ps.compliance.protection.office365.us/powershell-liveid/`
    - Security & Compliance Center PowerShell in Microsoft DoD: `https://l5.ps.compliance.protection.office365.us/powershell-liveid/`
    - Exchange Online Protection PowerShell in standalone EOP organizations without Exchange Online mailboxes: `https://ps.protection.outlook.com/powershell-liveid/`

  defaultValue: None
  position: "0"
  aliases: ""

  - Exchange Online
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="PSCredential" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Credential
  description: |+
    The Credential parameter specifies the username and password that's used to connect to Exchange Online PowerShell. Typically, you use this parameter in scripts or when you need to provide different credentials that have the required permissions. Don't use this parameter for accounts that use multi-factor authentication (MFA).

    Before you run the Connect-IPPSSession command, store the username and password in a variable (for example, `$UserCredential = Get-Credential`). Then, use the variable name (`$UserCredential`) for this parameter.

    After the Connect-IPPSSession command is complete, the password key in the variable is emptied.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  applicable:
  - Exchange Online
  parameterValueGroup: ""

  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Prefix
  description: |+
    The Prefix parameter specifies an alias to add to nouns in the names of older remote PowerShell cmdlets (cmdlet with nouns that don't already start with EXO). A valid value is a text string without spaces, and you can't use the value EXO (this prefix is reserved for PowerShell V2 module cmdlets).

  defaultValue: None
  position: "4"
  aliases: ""
  applicable:
  - Exchange Online
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="PSSessionOption" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: PSSessionOption
  description: |+
    The PSSessionOption parameter specifies the PowerShell session options to use in your connection to Exchange Online. You store the output of the [New-PSSessionOption](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/new-pssessionoption) command in a variable, for example:

    `$Options = New-PSSessionOption <Settings>`

    And you use the variable name as the value for this parameter (for example, `$Options`).

  defaultValue: None
  position: "3"
  aliases: ""
  applicable:
  - Exchange Online
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: UserPrincipalName
  description: |+
    The UserPrincipalName parameter specifies the account that you want to use to connect (for example, navin@contoso.onmicrosoft.com). Using this parameter allows you to skip the username dialog in the modern authentication prompt for credentials (you only need to enter your password).

    If you use the UserPrincipalName parameter, you don't need to use the AzureADAuthorizationEndpointUri parameter for MFA or federated users in environments that normally require it (UserPrincipalName or AzureADAuthorizationEndpointUri is required; OK to use both).
